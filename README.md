# MouseTrap

This is an exploration of react hooks while having fun with content and using react-bootstrap components.

Things used in this web example:
- React: https://reactjs.org/
 - React Hooks: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
- react-bootstrap: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts
- Webpack: https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack
- eslint: https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint
- Themes for Bootstrap: https://bootswatch.com

# Hooks

I've used several of the basic hooks, shown in many examples.  I thing that stood out for me, was how to use an effect when calling async functions.  This is shown in the trapdetail.js file.

hooks used:
- useState
- useReducer
- useEffect


# Data

I've abstrated the data interface so the site can be easyly configured to use any backend.  Currenly the site uses local storage.
